## _My Definition of Big Data:_
> ``Big data can be defined as large and complex datasets with an enormous number of observations and features. It can grow at an exponential rate with time and requires special tools for anlysis. We can also look at the term "Big Data" from the point of view that its analysis can create a significantly "big" impact on society, government and business. For example, big data from GPS can be used to moniter traffic congestion which has major implications in our daily lives. It can also provide valueable information to the government regarding the required development or improvement of roadways. Furthermore, such data can be analysed by transport companies for efficient route planning and hence optimization of profits. ``

## _Adding Image_ : 
> When talking about "BIG" data, the element of nature that came to my mind were the giant Sequoia Trees. So, I am posting a picture clicked with **The General Sherman Tree** ,the largest in the world by _VOLUME_ at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters).
